All entities used to call a specific endpoint and is used to map the response of the endpoint. Each entity are described in the entities section. Finally, you need to give an id , the name , or the limit of the list to get the entity or the list of entities given in the generic parameter. All parameters for the get() method are described below. With id of the pokemon You can get a pokemon with the id of the pokemon. For example, you can get the pokemon with id 25 as Pikachu. val pikachu = PokeApi.get<Pokemon>(id = 25) With name of the pokemon Same thing, but here you can use the name of the pokemon.
